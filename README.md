## Writing Clean Code

* Follow python conventions (PEP 8) clearly for things like naming variables, constants, functions, and classes.
* Follow a Single Responsibility Rule (SRP) for using functions. Ensure that each function or method performs only one
  task.
* Itâ€™s best to avoid global variables to prevent unexpected issues.
* Add comments where needed to explain your logic, and use docstrings for functions and classes to clarify what they do.
