# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

The step in which you program the code are changing entirely. We are expected to code like developing an 
actual project.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think I still need to review all the patterns carefully to ensure I understand how everything works. And time-limited
coding practices on paper to prepare for the exam.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am reviewing everything as much as I can for the lessons learned.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think I need to stop procrastinating the practice exercises and do them after weekly works.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

If possible I want some sample for most common scenarios instead of one general code or questions that cover those 
scenarios so that I can practice them.
